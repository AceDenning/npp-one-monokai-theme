One Monokai Theme for Notepad++
=============

Based on the popular Monokai theme and One Dark theme for VS Code, This is my setup for wokring with HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS files, other languages have been tested.

This is as close as I can get to a replica of the Visual Studio 2012's Dark theme in Notepad++. I created it to ease switching between files opened in Visual Studio and Notepad++. Particularly close attention has been paid to C, C++, and XML but a number of other languages have been tested.
